 ## Project Description

For this challenge , we will be assessed on the following :

 ## Installment Instructions

In order to set up the project, we have to do the following:

- On canvas, a zip file has been provided which we are supposed to download.
- Once downloaded, extract it on to your computer.
- When you have accessed the zip file, start it by typing ./bin/start.py <your-name> thus creating a new directory called code-challenge.
- cd  to and open the new  code-challenge/  directory into your vscode.

  
 ## Usage

In order to get the test to run , you have to do following:
- On the terminal, cd into the name of the folder which you have created for the project.
- Next, activate the virtual environment by typing pipenv shell .
- Then, you're going to create the tables for the database. To do this, type the following:
  a. flask db init
  b. flask db migrate
  c. flask db upgrade

- To get the server to run , type python3 app.py (backend)
- To go live, run npm install then npm start on the terminal (frontend)
  
  
- Once you've gone live, a webpage called The Pizza Society appears, here it has a plethora of different restaurants available
